Simple Group Chat
-----------------

`draft` `optional` `author:fiatjaf` `author:ismyhc` `depends:33` `depends:27` `depends:11` `depends:42`

This NIP defines a model for group chat that relies on relays as ultimate sources of authority. Clients can connect to multiple relays and interact with different groups in each of these relays. A group can live in more than one relay or migrate between relays, but for practical purposes it is expected to rely on a single relay for as long as that is working well. This approach minimizes bandwidth consumption and computation costs and ensures the group can have fine-grained permissions and other niceties commonly expected from any group chat platforms without putting a huge amount of overhead on clients. The fundamental assumption here is that censorship is not a big concern for this kind of application.

Each group has an identifier, which is used as the `d` tag (see [NIP-33](33.md)) in events that hold group metadata. The default top-level group in a relay is identified by `"/"`, with subgroups added after the slash and even deeper subgroups separated by other slashes. The imagined user flow for opening a group is to type a hostname with an optional path suffix. For example, if the user types `pizza.com/` that goes to the top-level group at the `wss://pizza.com` relay. If the user types `pizza.com/flavors` that goes to the group `"/flavors"` on the `wss://pizza.com` relay.

The entire metadata of the group (kinds `39000-3900x`) must only be signed by the relay main pubkey given by the `"pubkey"` field in the relay's [NIP-11](11.md) response. Other metadata events not signed by that public key must be ignored by clients. Upon opening a group, the chat client is supposed to fetch (or use locally cached values) these metadata events in order to render the group details, and then fetch the messages (`kind:9`).

### Event definitions

- *chat message* (`kind:9`)

This is the basic unit of a message sent to a group.

It must commit in the `g` tag to the subgroup path and also to the relay hostname (in order to prevent these events from being sent to other relays and groups out of context and cause confusion).

`e` and `p` tags can also be used to signal an immediate reply to another message on the group or to call for the attention of some other group user.

When inserting references -- in the body of the text -- to users, other messages (quotes) and to other Nostr events that outside of the group must be made following the [NIP-27](27.md) pattern (`nostr:nevent1...`).

```js
  "kind": 9,
  "content": "hello my friends lovers of pizza",
  "tags": [
    ["g", "/flavors", "pizza.com"]
  ]
  ...
```

- *group metadata* (`kind:39000`) (mandatory)

group metadata event will hold all the group infomration and users belong to that group. This event will also hold all the user pubkeys that are part of this group with roles. 

["<pubkey1-as-hex>", "role1", "role2"...],

pubkey1-as-hex and role 1 are mandatory 
role2 and above are optional.

Role 1 should have a minimum of two types such as "admin" and "user" where admin can modify metadata and users cannot. Fine grained controls can be added after role 1 to further define the user fine grained controls.  e.g. ["<pubkey1-as-hex>", "admin", "add-user", "edit-metadata", "delete-message", "ban-user"],


Client will connect to a relay and get all 39000 events. If the user tags exist in a group, then it will be displayed as subscribed groups. Other groups will be listed as available groups and the user can choose to subscribe to. 

Having the `"private"` tag means the group cannot be read and relays will use [NIP-42](42.md) `AUTH` messages to control who can read from it. The `"closed"` tag means the group can be read by anyone but only explicitly whitelisted pubkeys are allowed to post, again these enforcements happen at the relay level.
  
This event will be replaced by a new one whenever there is a change to metadata such as add user, remove user or change user permissions. This event is valid only when it is signed by the relay. Relay may enforce other conditions such as unique group name, number of users per group and group type. 
  
Group name cannot be changed after creation. Group names are unique within a relay. 
  
Subgroups like /flavors/pepperoni will have its own 39000 event but will not have users or roles. They will inherit them from /flavors. They are mainly used as filters within the group.
 

```js
{
  "kind": 39000,
  "content": "a nip-29 chat group for debating pizza flavors and other topics",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "/flavors"],
    ["name", "Pizza Lovers"],
    ["picture", "https://pizza.com/pizza.png"],
    ["private | "public"],
    ["closed" | "open"],
    ["<pubkey1-as-hex>", "admin", "role2"...],
    ["<pubkey2-as-hex>", "user", "role2"...],
  
  ]
  ...
}
```

Group names will follow the nostr:naddr scheme to point to the group directly. client will match the relay pubkey to NIP-11 relay document to confirm match. 
 
```js
  
  naddr {
  identifier: '/flavors',
  pubkey: <relay pubkey>,
  kind: 39000,
  relays: [ 'wss://pizza.com' ]
}

```
  
  



- *Group action event* (`kind:9000`) (mandatory)

An event sent from a client to the relay in order to accomplish a change to group metadata. The relay should read this event and act on it if the user sending the event has the required permissions and the date is close to the current date. If the group does not exist, then relay will create kind-39000 event and make this event pubkey as "admin".  The relay may discard the event after taking action or keep it as a way to expose a group action log. This is similar to the `kind:9` event in its structure.

```js
{
  "kind": 9000,
  "content": "action description and/or reason",
  "tags": [
    ["g", "/flavors", "pizza.com"],
    ["action", "user-add", "<pubkey-to-add>"],
    ["action", "user-remove", "<pubkey-to-remove>"],
    ["action", "role-add", "admin",  "<pubkey-to-remove>"],
    ["action", "role-remove", "admin", "<pubkey-to-remove>"],
    ["action", "name-change",  "Iceream lovers"],
    ["action", "picture-change", "https://pizza.com/pizza2.png"],  
,
  ]
}
```
  
  
Admin/group creation flow:

Goto relay webpage.
register/pay to get access
Click add to create a group
Fill in metadata info, add initial users
create/sign event 9000 and submit it to relay.
Relay takes info and signs it with its key and creates event 39000 and provides a nostr: id that can be shared with users.

User flow

Click on nostr: link and it will open the relay registration page. If the user pubkey is already registered then it can NIP-42 Auth and provide the list of all groups.
If not, user can register/pay for the relay to get NIP42-Authed.
Relay will then provide a list of all 39000 events
In the list of groups, click any group and join.
See list of events and also post new messages in the group.
